I’m Mahsa, a DevOps/Cloud Engineer passionate about technology, automation, and system design. I created this space to document my learning journey—exploring new technologies, tackling challenges, and refining my approach to engineering and problem-solving.

Over the years, I’ve worked in diverse environments, gaining insights that shaped my technical mindset. This blog serves as a personal knowledge base, where I share lessons learned, projects I’ve built, and ideas that inspire me.
